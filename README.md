Description
===========
*ydecryp.py* is a simple and fast program to crack and check hashes with Google searches.

Why?
----
Because I liked Juuso's idea (https://github.com/juuso/BozoCrack), but I wanted something written in python to play with it.

Usage
=====
`$ ./ydecrypt -h`
`usage: ydecrypt.py [-h] [--crack-hash HASH] [--check STRING] [-f FILE]`
``
`Crack/Check Hashes with Google.`
``
`optional arguments:`
`  -h, --help            show this help message and exit`
`  --crack-hash HASH     crack the given hash`
`  --check STRING        check if google has a hash for the given string`
`  -f FILE, --file FILE  read hashes from file`
