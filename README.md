Description
===========
*ydecryp.py* is a simple and fast program to crack and check hashes with Google searches.

Why?
----
Because I liked Juuso's idea (https://github.com/juuso/BozoCrack), but I wanted something written in python to play with it.

Usage
=====
`usage: ydecrypt.py [-h] [--crack-hash HASH] [--check STRING] [-f FILE]`
